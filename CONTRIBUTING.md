# Contributing Guidelines  

## ❗️ Before you start...  

- Make sure an [issue](https://github.com/LabelWorkshop/ios/issues) for your feature/fix is open and you have gotten permission from a team member
    - If there is already an assigniee for the issue it's very likely taken
- Don't create large pull requests with refactors without a disscusion with a team member
- Make sure no one else has opened a PR for the same issue
- If a fix is something super small such as a typo then don't worry about creating an issue

## 🧑‍💻 Developent
Open the project in the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Xcode-beta](https://developer.apple.com/download/applications/). For testing have an iOS Simulator of 17.0 or later (preferably the newest).

## 🎨 Code Style
- No more than 100 characters per line
- Use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for variables and functions
- Use [UpperCamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for classes and structs
- As of now do not edit code in `Library.swift` as it is very messy and needs to be refactored

## 👨‍🎨 Commit & PR Style
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as a guideline for BOTH commits & PRs
- Use the default provided PR template unless your PR doesn't change code
